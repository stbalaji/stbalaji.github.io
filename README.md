I am Balaji S. Thiruvenkatachari. Welcome to my Github Site where I share few AI, ML and Data Projects ! 

Here are few Cases studies from the Real-world 

A) Using Machine Learning to Improve Streaming Quality at Netflix (Chaitanya Ekanadham from Netflix Technology Blog, 2018)
https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/using-machine-learning-to-improve-streaming-quality-at-netflix-9651263ef09f

We know that Netflix streams Video Content to Millions of members. In this blog we can learn about the technical challenges and ML approaches to overcome these challenges. Example:
- Detect device anomaly
- Network Quality
- Allocate resources for caching.

B) Using Machine Learning to Predict Value of Homes On Airbnb (Robert Chang, Airbnb Engineering & Data Science, 2017)
https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/using-machine-learning-to-improve-streaming-quality-at-netflix-9651263ef09f

In this blog, we can learn about how Airbnb used ML to drive business impact or outcome. In the case of Airbnb this outcome was to predict the value of homes on Airbnb. We can learn about the ML lifecycle and learnings. 

C) Creating a Modern OCR Pipeline Using Computer Vision and Deep Learning (Brad Neuberg, Dropbox Engineering, 2017)
